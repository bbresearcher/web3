## Concepts
### What is ETH 2.0
Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work, this introduces sharding which increases speed and throughput.

### What is Layer 2
Layer 2 is transactions/computing off of Layer1 (Mainnet) to lower costs and increase speed.
current scaling solutions
- Channels (State and payment channels, allows users to share transactions many time while only submitting 2 transactions.) (application specific no open participation cant be used to scale general smart contracts)RADEUM
- Plasma framework for building apps on ethereum.OMG
- Side chains ETH compatible blockchains
- Rollups bundle TX in a single TX (SNARK) ZK ROLLUPS AND OPTIMISTIC ROLLUPS (OVM)

### What is the EVM
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)<br/>
Quasi-turing complete<br/>
State machine<br/>
1) List accounts and balances.<br/>
2) List of Smart Contracts and their data.

### Ethereum Transaction structure
- From
- To (zeros is deploy new contract)
- Value
- Data/Input
- Gas Price
- Gas Limit
- Nonce
- v,r,s



### What is GAS Optimisation

### What is QA(in a audit report)

### What is the ETH DNS and Vulnerablitites
Ethereum Name Service (ENS)<br/>
Its like a DNS for the blockchain, it supports sub-domains and the owner can configure them.<br/>
Link: https://docs.ens.domains/ <br/>
top level domains are owned by owner contract eg. <b>.eth</b> and <b>.test</b><br/>
Can be used by a user or a contract.<br/>

### What is a proxy

### When is a proxy unintialized and how to check

### What is Compound

### What is OpenZeppelin

### What is UniSwap and how does it work

### What is MasterChef

### What was the DAO Hack
Smart contract called DAO, was the largest crowd fund at that point, it was a reentrancy hack on fallback function<br/>

### What is an Oracle and how can it be manipulated

### What is ChainLink
